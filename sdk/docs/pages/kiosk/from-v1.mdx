# Migrating from Kiosk SDK V1

## Introduction

While The original version of Kiosk SDK V1 was a quick way to experiment with the Kiosk API, the new
version of the SDK offers a more robust way to build kiosk/transfer policy transactions.

One extra benefit of the new SDK is it offers a builder-pattern API, which makes it easier to
autocomplete what you're trying to do, and also makes it easier to read the code.

While it's hard to provide a one-to-one mapping between the old and new SDK, the following examples
should help you get started.

> An important benefit of the new SDK is that it works seamlessly with Personal Kiosk, which would
> be hard to do with the V1 SDK (you would always have to wrap the transaction with
> `borrow_cap / return_cap` calls depending on whether the kiosk is personal or not).

## Placing an item to kiosk and listing for sale

### V1 Implementation

The following example was taken from the original Kiosk SDK V1 documentation:

```typescript
import { placeAndList } from '@mysten/kiosk';
import { TransactionBlock } from '@mysten/sui.js/transactions';

const placeAndListToKiosk = async () => {
	const kiosk = 'SomeKioskId';
	const kioskCap = 'KioskCapObjectId';
	const itemType = '0xItemAddr::some:ItemType';
	const item = 'SomeItemId';
	const price = '100000';

	const tx = new TransactionBlock();

	placeAndList(tx, itemType, kiosk, kioskCap, item, price);

	// ... continue to sign and execute the transaction
	// ...
};
```

### V2 Implementation

On the new SDK, the same transaction can be built as follows:

```typescript
/// You need to do this only once and re-use it in the application.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
	client: new SuiClient({
		url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet'),
	}),
	network: Network.MAINNET,
});

const placeAndListToKiosk = async () => {
	// We probably have saved the user's preferred kiosk Cap somewhere in our app's state.
	const { kioskOwnerCaps } = await kioskClient.getOwnedKiosks({ address: '0xSomeAddress' });

	const txb = new TransactionBlock();

	// assume we use the first owned kiosk.
	new KioskTransaction({ transactionBlock: txb, kioskClient, cap: kioskOwnerCaps[0] })
		.placeAndList({
			itemType: '0xItemAddr::some:ItemType',
			item: 'SomeItemId',
			price: '100000',
		})
		.finalize();

	// ... continue to sign and execute the transaction
};
```

## Create a new kiosk

### V1 Implementation

The following example was taken from the original Kiosk SDK V1 documentation:

```typescript
import { createKioskAndShare } from '@mysten/kiosk';
import { TransactionBlock } from '@mysten/sui.js/transactions';

const createKiosk = async () => {
	const accountAddress = '0xSomeSuiAddress';

	const tx = new TransactionBlock();
	const kiosk_cap = createKioskAndShare(tx);

	tx.transferObjects([kiosk_cap], tx.pure(accountAddress, 'address'));

	// ... continue to sign and execute the transaction
	// ...
};
```

### V2 Implementation

On the new SDK, the same transaction can be built as follows:

```typescript
/// You need to do this only once and re-use it in the application.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
	client: new SuiClient({
		url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet'),
	}),
	network: Network.MAINNET,
});

const placeAndListToKiosk = async () => {
	const txb = new TransactionBlock();

	const kioskTx = new KioskTransaction({ transactionBlock: txb, kioskClient });

	kioskTx.shareAndTransferCap('0xSomeSuiAddress').finalize();

	// ... continue to sign and execute the transaction
};
```

## Purchasing an item and resolving rules

### V1 Implementation

The following example was taken from the original Kiosk SDK V1 documentation:

```typescript
import { queryTransferPolicy, purchaseAndResolvePolicies, place, testnetEnvironment } from '@mysten/kiosk';
import { SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient(
  url: 'https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443',
);

 // the kiosk we're purchasing from
const kioskId = `0xSomeKioskAddress`;
// a sample item retrieved from `fetchKiosk` function (or hard-coded)
const item = {
  isLocked: false,
  objectId: "0xb892d61a9992a10c9453efcdbd14ca9720d7dc1000a2048224209c9e544ed223"
  type: "0x52852c4ba80040395b259c641e70b702426a58990ff73cecf5afd31954429090::test::TestItem",
  listing: {
    isExclusive: false,
    listingId: "0x368b512ff2514dbea814f26ec9a3d41198c00e8ed778099961e9ed22a9f0032b",
    price: "20000000000" // in MIST
  }
}
const ownedKiosk = `0xMyKioskAddress`;
const ownedKioskCap = `0xMyKioskOwnerCap`;

const purchaseItem = async (item, kioskId) => {

  // fetch the policy of the item (could be an array, if there's more than one transfer policy)
  const policies = await queryTransferPolicy(client, item.type);
  // selecting the first one for simplicity.
  const policyId = policy[0]?.id;
  // initialize tx block.
  const tx = new TransactionBlock();

  // Both are required if you there is a `kiosk_lock_rule`.
  // Optional otherwise. Function will throw an error if there's a kiosk_lock_rule and these are missing.
  const extraParams = {
    ownedKiosk,
    ownedKioskCap
  }
  // Define the environment.
  // To use a custom package address for rules, you could call:
  // const environment = customEnvironment('<PackageAddress>');
  const environment = testnetEnvironment;

  // Extra params. Optional, but required if the user tries to resolve a `kiosk_lock_rule`.
  // Purchases the item. Supports `kiosk_lock_rule`, `royalty_rule` (accepts combination too).
  const result = purchaseAndResolvePolicies(tx, item.type, item.listing.price, kioskId, item.objectId, policy[0], environment, extraParams);

  // result = {item: <the_purchased_item>, canTransfer: true/false // depending on whether there was a kiosk lock rule }
  // if the item didn't have a kiosk_lock_rule, we need to do something with it.
  // for e..g place it in our own kiosk. (demonstrated below)
  if(result.canTransfer) place(tx, item.type, ownedKiosk, ownedKioskCap , result.item);

  // ...finally, sign PTB & execute it.

};
```

### V2 Implementation

On the new SDK, the same transaction can be built as follows:

> This would work both with personal and non personal kiosks.

```typescript
/// You need to do this only once and re-use it in the application.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
    client: new SuiClient({
        url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet'),
    }),
    network: Network.MAINNET,
});

// An Item as returned from `kioskClient.getKiosk()` call.
const item = {
  isLocked: false,
  objectId: "0xb892d61a9992a10c9453efcdbd14ca9720d7dc1000a2048224209c9e544ed223"
  type: "0x52852c4ba80040395b259c641e70b702426a58990ff73cecf5afd31954429090::test::TestItem",
  kioskId: '0xSomeKioskAddress',
  listing: {
    isExclusive: false,
    listingId: "0x368b512ff2514dbea814f26ec9a3d41198c00e8ed778099961e9ed22a9f0032b",
    price: "20000000000" // in MIST
  }
}

const purchase = async () => {
	// We probably have saved the user's preferred kiosk Cap somewhere in our app's state.
    // We wouldn't need to query this every time we purchase.
    const { kioskOwnerCaps } = await kioskClient.getOwnedKiosks({ address: '0xSomeAddress' });

    const txb = new TransactionBlock();

    const kioskTx = new KioskTransaction({ transactionBlock: txb, kioskClient, cap: kioskOwnerCaps[0] });

    // purchase the item and resolve the rules
    await kioskTx.purchaseAndResolve({
        itemType: item.type,
        itemId: item.objectId,
        price: item.listing.price,
        sellerKiosk: item.kioskId,
    });

    kioskTx.finalize();
};
```

## Attach Rules to Transfer Policy

### V1 Implementation

The following example was taken from the original Kiosk SDK V1 documentation:

```typescript
import {
	createTransferPolicy,
	attachKioskLockRule,
	attachRoyaltyRule,
	testnetEnvironment,
	percentageToBasisPoints,
} from '@mysten/kiosk';
import { TransactionBlock } from '@mysten/sui.js/transactions';

// Attaches a royalty rule of 1% or 0.1 SUI (whichever is bigger)
// as well as a kiosk lock, making the objects trade-able only from/to a kiosk.
const attachStrongRoyalties = async () => {
	const type = 'SomePackageId::type::MyType'; // the Type for which we're attaching rules.
	const policyId = 'policyObjectId'; // the transfer Policy ID that was created for that Type.
	const transferPolicyCap = 'transferPolicyCapId'; // the transferPolicyCap for that policy.

	// royalties configuration.
	const percentage = 2.55; // 2.55%
	const minAmount = 100_000_000; // 0.1 SUI.

	// the environment on which we're referecing the rules package.
	// use `mainnetEnvironment` for mainnet.
	const enviroment = testnetEnvironment;

	const tx = new TransactionBlock();

	attachKioskLockRule(tx, type, policyId, policyCapId, enviroment);
	attachRoyaltyRule(
		tx,
		type,
		policyId,
		policyCapId,
		percentageToBasisPoints(percentage),
		minAmount,
		enviroment,
	);

	// ... continue to sign and execute the transaction
	// ...
};
```

### V2 Implementation

On the new SDK, the same transaction can be built as follows:

```typescript
/// You need to do this only once and re-use it in the application.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
	client: new SuiClient({
		url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet'),
	}),
	network: Network.MAINNET,
});

const adjustPolicy = async () => {
	const txb = new TransactionBlock();

	// You could have more than one cap, since you can create more than one transfer policy.
	const policyCaps = await kioskClient.getOwnedTransferPoliciesByType({
		type: `SomePackageId::type::MyType`,
		address: '0xOwnerAddress',
	});

	new TransferPolicyTransaction({ transactionBlock: txb, kioskClient, cap: policyCaps[0] })
		.addRoyaltyRule(percentageToBasisPoints(2.55), 100_000_000)
		.addLockRule();

	// ... continue to sign and execute the transaction
	// ...
};
```
