# Kiosk SDK

Kiosk SDK is a tool to interact with Sui/Mysten Kiosk. You can use it to query kiosk
related data, easily build transactions to interact, and build on top of it to support custom rules.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/kiosk
```

## About

To use the Kiosk SDK, you have to create a `KioskClient` instance. This instance will be used to
hold the state of `SuiClient`, `Network`, and the rules & packageIds for interacting with Mysten
Kiosk Extension.
