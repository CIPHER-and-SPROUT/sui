# The `@msyten/sui.js/utils` package

This package contains some utilities that simplify common operations when working with the Sui
typescript SDK.

## Constants

A number of constants exported for common uses cases:

- `MIST_PER_SUI`: The conversion rate for mist to sui (1,000,000,000)
- `SUI_DECIMALS`: The number of decimals places that a mist value needs to be shifted to be
  converted to sui (9)
- `SUI_ADDRESS_LENGTH: The number of bytes in a sui address (32)
- `MOVE_STDLIB_ADDRESS`: The address for teh move standard library
- `SUI_FRAMEWORK_ADDRESS`: The address for the sui framework
- `SUI_SYSTEM_ADDRESS`: The address for the sui system module
- `SUI_CLOCK_OBJECT_ID`: The address for the `sui::clock::Clock` object
- `SUI_SYSTEM_STATE_OBJECT_ID`: The address for the `SuiSystemState` object

## Formatters

The following helpers can be used for formatting various values:

- `formatAddress`
- `formatDigest`
- `normalizeStructTag`
- `normalizeSuiAddress`
- `normalizeSuiObjectId`

## Validators

The following helpers can be used to validate the format of various values (this only validates that
the value is in the correct format, but does not validate the value is valid for a specific use
case, or exists on chain).

- `isValidSuiAddress`
- `isValidSuiObjectId`
- `isValidTransactionDigest`

## Encoding

The following methods are re-exported to help with converting between commonly used encodings

- `fromHEX`: Serializes a Uint8Array to a hex string
- `toHEX`: Deserializes a hex string to a Uint8Array
- `fromB64`: Serializes a Uint8Array to a base64 string
- `toB64`: Deserializes a base64 string to a Uint8Array
