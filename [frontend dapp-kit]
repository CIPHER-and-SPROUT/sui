In certain scenarios, dApp needs to utilize useQueries for data retrieval.

Here is an example:

const { data: coinBalanceList = [] } = useSuiClientQuery("getAllBalances", {
  owner: walletAddress,
});

// After obtaining the balance for each coin, 
// it is necessary to further retrieve the metadata for each individual coin.
const coinListMetadata = useSuiClientQueries(
  ...coinBalanceList.map(
    (coin): ["getCoinMetadata", SuiRpcMethods["getCoinMetadata"]["params"]] => {
      return [
        "getCoinMetadata",
        {
          coinType: coin.coinType,
        },
      ];
    }
  )
);

const metadataList: CoinMetadata[] = coinListMetadata.map((data) => data);
With the useSuiClientQueries hook, retrieving the aforementioned data will be much more easy.

If there are any changes needed or if you have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me at any time!
Thanks!
