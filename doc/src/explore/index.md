title: Exploring Sui
---

Now that you've [learned](../learn/index.md) about Sui and started [building](../build/index.md) it, use the contents of this section to delve into Sui more deeply by:

* Taking an end-to-end [tutorial](../explore/tutorials.md) from starting a Sui network locally to publishing a TicTacToe game on Sui and playing it.
* Trying out [examples](../explore/examples.md) supplied by the Sui team to help you understand how objects are structured and manipulated.
* Navigating the [Sui Explorer](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/explorer-rest/explorer) and [Sui Explorer Client](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/explorer-rest/explorer/client) to see the latest blocks, transactions, and cluster statistics.
* Viewing [prototypes](../explore/prototypes.md) of games built by third parties demonstrating the power of Sui.
