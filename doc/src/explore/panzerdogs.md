title: Panzerdogs x Sui
---

Panzerdogs is an NFT gaming project where users can own their in-game assets and use them to battle against each other in tanks. Brawl Stars x Tanks x Play-To-Earn.

Panzerdogs is developed by Lucky Kat Studios. Their approach is game first then blockchain, and they believe blockchain technology will enable new ways for Panzerdogs players to interact with the game. Together with the community, Panzerdogs is building a game that is accessible for a wide audience and fun to play.

Panzerdogs teamed up with Mysten Labs to create a demo showcasing how Sui’s performance will help lead the synergies between gaming and blockchain technologies. In particular, our goal is to highlight how Sui can be used to create a tight feedback loop between on-chain asset ownership and gameplay. 

## SuiEcho

SuiEcho is one of the first open source tools we are building to grow the Sui ecosystem. Specifically, SuiEcho lets owners of existing NFTs port them into Sui and use them to explore new functionality (read more about SuiEcho here).

An exciting feature of the Panzerdogs gameplay is that it lets users port-in their NFTs to be used as avatars within their game. Sui is optimized to deliver high throughput, low latency, and low cost, making an ideal network for running in-game assets that need to move around often, cheaply, and easily. More importantly, Sui’s design enables fully on-chain data storage, implying that in-game customizations and upgrades can be immediately reflected on Sui. These characteristics make Sui an ideal platform for running a game such as Panzerdogs, where the user’s NFTs and gameplay are deeply intertwined.

## How does SuiEcho work?

Beyond optimizing Sui’s performance, one of our goals is to create the tooling that makes Sui accessible and easy to use (read more about our Sui Developer Kit here). In that spirit, we’re in the process of creating a simple SuiEcho white label solution to help users create Sui-based NFTs.

The SuiEcho white label begins by asking users to connect their existing address from other networks. This makes the cross-chain user interface as easy as possible from the user’s perspective.

The user can then visualize their overall NFT portfolio and choose which to Echo into Sui.

Finally, users prove ownership to the Sui network by providing a signature confirming they indeed hold the private keys to the associated address and include the Sui address where the Sui-based NFT will be minted.

And that’s it! After following these steps, the user now owns a new Sui-based NFT that was brought into Sui through the SuiEcho white-label solution. To confirm ownership, the user can check the [Sui Explorer](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/explorer-rest/explorer/README.md) and read additional information relevant to each NFT.

With SuiEcho, users can easily bring in their NFTs to Sui and unlock new functionality. Now users are ready to use their NFTs as avatars within Panzerdogs and explore the many rich synergies between on-chain ownership and gameplay.

**What’s Next?**

This is just the beginning. Sui is built to deliver NFTs with utility, ensuring their value rises not just out of scarcity but also because users can unlock cool new experiences and functionality with them. For example, in the future we will likely see the Panzerdogs NFTs evolve based on what happens in the game. The Sui platform will be able to fully take advantage of these features by recording the mutations on-chain and ensuring a tight flywheel between gameplay, NFT ownership, and the game’s economy.
