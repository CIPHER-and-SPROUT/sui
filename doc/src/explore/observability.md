# Logging, Tracing, Metrics, and Observability

Good observability facilities are key to the development and growth of Sui.  This is made
more challenging by the distributed and asynchronous nature of Sui, with multiple client and authority
processes distributed over a potentially global network.

The observability stack in Sui is based on the [Tokio tracing](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-08-tracing) library.
The rest of this document highlights specific aspects of achieving good observability through useful logging
and metrics in Sui.

NOTE: The output here is largely for the consumption of Sui operators, administrators, and developers.  The
content of logs and traces do not represent the authoritative, certified output of authorities and are subject
to potentially byzantine behavior.

## Contexts, scopes, and tracing transaction flow

The main idea of logging and tracing in a distributed and asynchronous context, where you cannot rely on looking
at individual logs over time in a single thread, is to assign context to logging/tracing so that we can trace,
for example, individual transactions.  Context uses key-value pairs so that we can easily filter on subsets
and examine individual flows, across both thread/task and process boundaries.

Here is a table/summary of context information that we will want:

- TX Digest
- Object reference/ID, when applicable
- Address/account
- Certificate digest, if applicable
- For Client HTTP endpoint: route, method, status
- Epoch
- Host information, for both clients and authorities

Example output which shows both context (tx digests) and key-value pairs enhancing observability/filtering,
and tracing a transaction across the gateway (`authority_aggregator`) as well as the authority:

## Key-value pairs schema

### Span names

Spans capture not a single event but an entire block of time; so start, end, duration, etc. can be captured
and analyzed for tracing, performance analysis, etc.

|           Name          |       Place        |                                    Meaning                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| process_tx              | Gateway, Authority | Send transaction request, get back 2f+1 signatures and make certificate        |
| process_cert            | Gateway            | Send certificate to authorities to execute transaction                         |
| handle_cert             | Gateway, Authority | Handle certificate processing and Move execution                               |
| sync_cert               | Gateway, Authority | Gateway-initiated sync of data to authority                                    |
| tx_check_locks          | Authority          | Check locks on input objects of incoming transaction request                   |
| db_set_transaction_lock | Authority          | Database set transaction locks on new transaction                              |
| db_update_state         | Authority          | Update the database with certificate, effects after transaction Move execution |
|                         |                    |                                                                                |

### Tags - keys

The idea is that every event and span would get tagged with key-value pairs.  Events that log within any context or nested contexts would also inherit the context-level tags.
These tags represent *fields* that can be analyzed and filtered by.  For example, one could filter out broadcasts and see the errors for all instances where the bad stake exceeded a certain amount, but not enough for an error.

TODO: see if keys need to be scoped by contexts

|         Key         |      Place(s)      |                                  Meaning                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tx_digest           | Gateway, Authority | Hex digest of transaction                                                  |
| tx_kind             | Gateway, Authority | Kind of transaction: Transfer/Publish/Call                                 |
| quorum_threshold    | Gateway            | Numeric threshold of quorum stake needed for a transaction                 |
| validity_threshold  | Gateway            | Numeric threshold of maximum "bad stake" from errors that can be tolerated |
| num_errors          | Gateway            | Number of errors from authorities broadcast                                |
| good_stake          | Gateway            | Total amount of good stake from authorities who answered a broadcast       |
| bad_stake           | Gateway            | Total amount of bad stake from authorities, including errors               |
| num_signatures      | Gateway            | Number of signatures received from authorities broadcast                   |
| num_unique_effects  | Gateway            | Number of unique effects responses from authorities                        |
| num_inputs          | Authority          | Number of inputs for transaction processing                                |
| num_mutable_objects | Authority          | Number of mutable objects for transaction processing                       |
| gas_used            | Authority          | Amount of gas used by the transaction                                      |
|                     |                    |                                                                            |

## Logging levels

This is always tricky, to balance the right amount of verbosity especially by default -- while keeping in mind this is a high performance system.

| Level |                                              Type of Messages                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error | Process-level faults (not transaction-level errors, there could be a ton of those)                         |
| Warn  | Unusual or byzantine activity                                                                              |
| Info  | High level aggregate stats, major events related to data sync, epoch changes.                              |
| Debug | High level tracing for individual transactions, eg Gateway/client side -> authority -> Move execution etc. |
| Trace | Extremely detailed tracing for individual transactions                                                     |
|       |                                                                                                            |

Going from info to debug results in a much larger spew of messages.

The `RUST_LOG` environment variable can be used to set both the overall logging level as well as the level for
individual components, and even filtering down to specific spans or tags within spans are possible too.
For more details, please see the [EnvFilter](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) docs.

## (Re)Configuration

## Observability of MOVE programs, events, etc.

TODO.

We need to provide means to authenticate the events etc (by linking them to signed effects).

## Viewing logs, traces, metrics

The tracing architecture is based on the idea of [subscribers](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing#project-layout) which
can be plugged into the tracing library to process and forward output to different sinks for viewing.  Multiple
subscribers can be active at the same time.

```mermaid
graph TB;
Authority1 --> S1(open-telemetry)
Authority1 --> S2(stdout logging)
Authority1 --> S3(bunyan-formatter)
S3 --> Vector
Vector --> ElasticSearch
S1 --> Jaeger
Gateway --> SG1(open-telemetry)
Gateway --> SG3(bunyan-formatter)
SG1 --> Jaeger
SG3 --> Vector2
Vector2 --> ElasticSearch
```

In the graph above, there are multiple subscribers,  JSON logs can be for example fed via a local sidecar log forwarder such as
[Vector](https://vector.dev), and then onwards to destinations such as ElasticSearch.

The use of a log and metrics aggregator such as Vector allows for easy reconfiguration without interrupting the authority server,
as well as offloading observability traffic.

### Stdout (default)

By default, logs (but not spans) are formatted for human readability and output to stdout, with key-value tags at the end of every line.
`RUST_LOG` can be configured for custom logging output, including filtering - see the logging levels section above.

### Tracing and span output

Detailed span start and end logs can be generated by defining the `SUI_JSON_SPAN_LOGS` environment variable.  Note that this causes all output to be in JSON format, which is not as human-readable, so it is not enabled by default.
This output can easily be fed to backends such as ElasticSearch for indexing, alerts, aggregation, and analysis.

The example output below shows certificate processing in the authority with span logging. Note the START and END annotations,
and notice how DB_UPDATE_STATE which is nested is embedded within PROCESS_CERT.
Also notice `elapsed_milliseconds` which logs the duration of each span.

### Live async inspection / Tokio Console

[Tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) is an awesome CLI tool designed to analyze and help debug Rust apps using Tokio, in real time!  It relies on a special subscriber.

TODO: Add instructions for setting env var and building Sui specially to enable Tokio-console support.

NOTE: Adding Tokio-console support may significantly slow down Sui authorities/gateways.
