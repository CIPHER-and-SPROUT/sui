title: Using the Sui Wallet Browser Extension
---

Welcome to the [Sui Wallet Browser Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/albddfdbohgeonpapellnjadnddglhgn?hl=en&authuser=0) covering its installation and use. The Sui Wallet Browser Extension acts as your portal to the Web3 world.

The Sui Wallet Browser Extension lets you:

* Create, import, and persistently store the mnemonics and the derived private key
* Transfer coins
* See owned fungible tokens and NFTs
* Display recent transactions
* Go directly to the successful/failed transaction in the Sui Explorer

Note, the wallet will auto split/merge coins if the address does not have a Coin object with the exact transfer amount.

Initially, the Sui Wallet Browser Extension is aimed at Sui developers for testing purposes. As such, the tokens are of no value (just like the rest of [DevNet](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/src/explore/devnet.md)) and will disappear each time we reset the network. In time, the Sui Wallet Browser Extension will be production ready for real tokens.

This browser extension is a pared-down version of the [Sui Wallet command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/src/build/wallet.md) that provides greater ease of use for the most commonly used features. If you need more advanced features, such as merge/split coins or make arbitrary [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/src/build/move.md) calls, instead use the [Wallet CLI](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/src/build/wallet.md).
