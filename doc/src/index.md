title: Sui Developer Guides
---

Welcome to the documentation for the Sui platform. Since Sui is built upon the core [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) programming language,
you should familiarize yourself with it and use this content to apply the differences. For a summary of these differences, see [Why Sui?](learn/sui-move-diffs.md)

## Kickstart development

* To jump right into building smart contract applications on top of Sui, go to [Move Quick Start](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastnft/tree/main/doc/src/move.md).
* To experiment with a sample Sui wallet, check out [Wallet Quick Start](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastnft/tree/main/doc/src/wallet.md).
<!---* To understand what's possible by browsing examples of full-fledged applications and games built on top of Sui, review the [Demos](TODO).--->
* To understand what's possible by browsing Move code built on top of Sui, review the [examples](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastnft/tree/main/sui_programmability/examples/sources)
* To start coding against Sui's REST APIs, start with the [Sui API Reference](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/arun-koshy/sui-api)
* To go deep on how Sui works, understand [Key Concepts](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastnft/tree/main/doc/src/key-concepts.md).
* To learn what distinguishes Sui from other blockchain systems, see [What Makes Sui Different?](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastnft/tree/main/doc/src/what-makes-sui-different.md).
<!---* To experience Sui's speed and scalability for yourself, try [Benchmarking](TODO).--->
<!---* To see the current status of the Sui software/network and preview what's coming next, read through our [Roadmap](TODO).--->
