title: Wallet Quick Start
---

Welcome to the Sui tutorial on the sample Sui wallet developed
to facilitate local experimentation with Sui features using a
command line interface. In this document, we describe how to set up
Sui wallet and execute wallet commands through its command line
interface, *Wallet CLI*.


## Setup

### Build the binaries

In order to build a Move package and run code defined in this package,
clone the Sui repository to the current directory and build:


```shell
cargo build --release
cd target/release
```

This will create `sui` and `wallet` binaries in `target/release`
directory.

### Genesis

```shell
./sui genesis
```

The `genesis` command creates four authorities and five user accounts
each with five gas objects. These are Sui [objects](objects.md) used
to pay for Sui [transactions](transactions.md#transaction-metadata),
such other object transfers or smart contract (Move) calls. These
numbers represent a sample configuration and have been chosen somewhat
arbitrarily; the process of generating the genesis state can be
customized with additional accounts, objects, code, etc. as described
in [Genesis customization](#customize-genesis).

The network configuration is stored in `network.conf` and
can be used subsequently to start the network. `wallet.conf` and `wallet.key` are
also created to be used by the Sui wallet to manage the
newly created accounts.

### Wallet configuration
The genesis process creates a configuration file `wallet.conf`, and a keystore file `wallet.key` for the
Sui wallet.  The config file contains information of the accounts and
the Sui network gateway. The keystore file contains all the public-private key pair of the created accounts.
Sui wallet uses the network information in `wallet.conf` to communicate
with the Sui network authorities  and create transactions using the key
pairs residing in the keystore file.

Here is an example of `wallet.conf` showing the accounts and key pairs
in the wallet configuration (with some values omitted):

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    "48cf013a76d583c027720f7f9852deac7c84b923",
    ...
  ],
  "keystore": {
    "File": "./wallet.key"
  },
  "gateway": {
    "embedded": {
      "authorities": [
        {
          "name": "5f9701f4bd2cd7c2f1f23ac6d05515407879f0acf2611517ff188e59c5f61743",
          "host": "127.0.0.1",
          "base_port": 10000
        },
        ...
      ],
      "send_timeout": {
        "secs": 4,
        "nanos": 0
      },
      "recv_timeout": {
        "secs": 4,
        "nanos": 0
      },
      "buffer_size": 65507,
      "db_folder_path": "./client_db"
    }
  }
}
```
The `accounts` variable contains the account's address the wallet manages.
`gateway` contains the information of the Sui network that the wallet will be connecting to,
currently only `Embedded` gateway type is supported.

The `authorities` variable is part of the embedded gateway configuration, it contains Sui network
authorities' name, host and port information. It is used to establish connections to the Sui network.

Note `send_timeout`, `recv_timeout` and `buffer_size` are the network
parameters and `db_folder_path` is the path to the account's client state
database. This database stores all the transaction data, certificates
and object data belonging to the account.

#### Sui Network Gateway
The Sui network gateway is an abstraction layer that acts as the entry point to the Sui network.
Different gateway implementation can be use by the application layer base on their use cases.

##### Embedded Gateway
As the name suggests, embedded gateway embeds the gateway logic into the application;
all data will be stored locally and the application will make direct
connection to the authorities.

#### Key management
The key pairs are stored in `wallet.key`. However, this is not secure
and shouldn't be used in a production environment. We have plans to
implement more secure key management and support hardware signing in a future release.

:warning: **Do not use in production**: Keys are stored in file!

### Starting the network

Run the following command to start the local Sui network:

```shell
./sui start
```

or

```shell
./sui start --config [config file path]
```

The network config file path defaults to `./network.conf` if not
specified.

NOTE: For logs, set `RUST_LOG=debug` before invoking `./sui start`.


### Running interactive wallet

To start the interactive wallet:

```shell
./wallet
```

or

```shell
./wallet --config [config file path]
```

The wallet config file path defaults to `./wallet.conf` if not
specified.

The following commands are supported by the interactive wallet:

    `addresses`      Obtain the addresses managed by the wallet
    `call`           Call a Move function
    `gas`            Obtain all gas objects owned by the address
    `help`           Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    `new-address`    Generate new address and keypair
    `object`         Get object information
    `objects`        Obtain all objects owned by the address
    `publish`        Publish Move modules
    `sync`           Synchronize client state with authorities
    `transfer`       Transfer an object

Use `help <command>` to see more information on each command.

The wallet can also be used without the interactive shell

```shell
USAGE:
    wallet --no-shell [SUBCOMMAND]
```

For example, we can use the following command to see the list of
accounts available on the platform:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell addresses
```

The result of running this command should resemble the following output:

```shell
Showing 5 results.
0999FD9EEE3AD557112182E7CB5747A253132000
23F1D33B058CB784C0740A0139ED81AC71A11CE3
8F89E566BFB2F68DE0DB8E64F8335D957792A7E8
E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317
FF4480C3BB1E1B15CF245667B8448D930D2A05BB
```

But the actual address values will most likely differ
in your case (as will other values, such as object IDs, in the later
parts of this tutorial). Consequently, **do not copy and paste
the actual command from this tutorial as they are unlikely to work for
you verbatim**. Each time you create a config for the wallet, addresses
and object IDs will be assigned randomly. Consequently, you cannot rely
on copy-pasting commands that include these values, as they will be different
between different users/configs.

## Adding accounts to the wallet

Sui's genesis process will create five accounts by default; if that's
not enough, there are two ways to add accounts to the Sui wallet if needed.

#### Generating a new account

To create a new account, execute the `new-address` command:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell new-address
```

The output shows a confirmation after the account has been created:

```
Created new keypair for address : F456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD
```

#### Add existing accounts to `wallet.conf` manually.

If you have an existing key pair from an old wallet config, you can copy the account
address manually to the new `wallet.conf`'s accounts section, and add the key pair to the keystore file;
you won't be able to mutate objects if the account key is missing from the keystore.

Restart the Sui wallet after the modification; the new accounts will appear in the wallet if you query the addresses.

## View objects owned by the account
You can use the `objects` command to view the objects owned by the address.

`objects` command usage :

```shell
USAGE:
    objects [FLAGS] --address <address>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --json       Returns command outputs in JSON format
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --address <address>    Address owning the objects
```
To view the objects owned by the accounts created in genesis, run the following command (substitute the address with one of the genesis addresses in your wallet):
```shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address 0999FD9EEE3AD557112182E7CB5747A253132000
```
The result should resemble the following, which shows the object in the format of (`object_id`, `sequence_number`, `object_hash`).
```shell
Showing 5 results.
(531AE72F84014918704DF57DA990D08EFCA8BF02, SequenceNumber(0), o#fbded551c71121a42e079b5fd179da42c718220a11c9b24d4529e8421266a311)

(659EE95880712843537E7553DFF66D98E0CC5ABD, SequenceNumber(0), o#680c60440a4d624f780e013c99b75e906db398b3de85f92183c7d26c7bb378c2)
(9495C4EEEB6F935A2AA19D9BA5B3D1D47A30F32E, SequenceNumber(0), o#5236389cfe8ae26f4d0f62bfa8b8e579bc31ce85446a86aafcc8ac20aa04c3e7)
(C7CC5FA26A039CFA03B32FA56414DFCE19BA318C, SequenceNumber(0), o#6413c14ed7ce43bd3b354c431260725773f838c7a193caae85bac97e10f0d38e)
```
If you want to view more information about the objects, you can use the `object` command.

Usage of `object` command :
```shell
USAGE:
    object [FLAGS] --id <id>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --json       Returns command outputs in JSON format
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --id <id>    Object ID of the object to fetch
```
To view the object, use the following command:
```bash
./wallet --no-shell object --id C7CC5FA26A039CFA03B32FA56414DFCE19BA318C
```
This should give you output similar to the following:
```shell
Owner: AddressOwner(k#0999fd9eee3ad557112182e7cb5747a253132000)
Version: 0
ID: C7CC5FA26A039CFA03B32FA56414DFCE19BA318C
Readonly: false
Type: 0x2::Coin::Coin<0x2::GAS::GAS>
```
The result shows some basic information about the object, the owner,
version, ID, if the object is immutable and the type of the object.
If you need a deeper look into the object, you can use the `--json`
flag to view the raw JSON representation of the object.

Here is an example:
```json
{"contents":{"fields":{"id":{"fields":{"id":{"fields":{"id":{"fields":{"bytes":"c7cc5fa26a039cfa03b32fa56414dfce19ba318c"},"type":"0x2::ID::ID"}},"type":"0x2::ID::UniqueID"},"version":0},"type":"0x2::ID::VersionedID"},"value":100000},"type":"0x2::Coin::Coin<0x2::GAS::GAS>"},"owner":{"AddressOwner":[9,153,253,158,238,58,213,87,17,33,130,231,203,87,71,162,83,19,32,0]},"tx_digest":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}
```

## Transferring objects
If you inspect a newly created account, you would expect the account does not own any object. Let us inspect the fresh account we create in the [Generating a new account](#generating-a-new-account) section (`F456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD`):

```shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address F456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD
Showing 0 results.

```
To add objects to the account, you can [invoke a move function](#calling-move-code),
or you can transfer one of the existing objects from the genesis account to the new account using a dedicated wallet command.
We will explore how to transfer objects using the wallet in this section.

`transfer` command usage:
```shell
USAGE:
    transfer [FLAGS] --gas <gas> --object-id <object-id> --to <to>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --json       Returns command outputs in JSON format
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --gas <gas>                ID of the gas object for gas payment, in 20 bytes Hex string
        --object-id <object-id>    Object to transfer, in 20 bytes Hex string
        --to <to>                  Recipient address
```
To transfer an object to a recipient, you will need the recipient's address,
the object ID of the object that you want to transfer,
and the gas object' ID for the transaction fee payment.

Here is an example transfer of an object to account `F456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD`.
```shell
./wallet --no-shell transfer --to F456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD --object-id 9495C4EEEB6F935A2AA19D9BA5B3D1D47A30F32E --gas 531AE72F84014918704DF57DA990D08EFCA8BF02

```

## Merging and splitting coin objects
Overtime, the account might receive coins from other accounts and will become unmanageable when
the number of coins grows; contrarily, the account might need to split the coins for payment or
for transfer to another account.

We can use the `merge-coin` command and `split-coin` command to consolidate or split coins, respectively.

### Merge coins
Usage of `merge-coin`:
```shell
USAGE:
    merge-coin [FLAGS] --coin-to-merge <coin-to-merge> --gas <gas> --gas-budget <gas-budget> --primary-coin <primary-coin>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --json       Returns command outputs in JSON format
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --coin-to-merge <coin-to-merge>    Coin to be merged, in 20 bytes Hex string
        --gas <gas>                        ID of the gas object for gas payment, in 20 bytes Hex string
        --gas-budget <gas-budget>          Gas budget for this call
        --primary-coin <primary-coin>      Coin to merge into, in 20 bytes Hex string
```
Here is an example of how to merge coins. To merge coins, you will need at lease three coin objects -
two coin objects for merging, and one for the gas payment.
You also need to specify the maximum gas budget that should be expanded for the coin merge operations.
Let us examine objects owned by address `FF4480C3BB1E1B15CF245667B8448D930D2A05BB`
and use the first coin (gas) object as the one to be the result of the merge, the second one to be merged, and the third one to be used as payment:

```shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address FF4480C3BB1E1B15CF245667B8448D930D2A05BB
Showing 5 results.

### Split coins
Usage of `split-coin`:
```shell
USAGE:
    split-coin [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --coin-id <coin-id> --gas <gas> --gas-budget <gas-budget>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --json       Returns command outputs in JSON format
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --amounts <amounts>...       Amount to split out from the coin
        --coin-id <coin-id>          Coin to Split, in 20 bytes Hex string
        --gas <gas>                  ID of the gas object for gas payment, in 20 bytes Hex string
        --gas-budget <gas-budget>    Gas budget for this call
```
For splitting coins, you will need at lease two coins to execute the `split-coin` command,
one coin to split, one for the gas payment.

Let us examine objects owned by address `8F89E566BFB2F68DE0DB8E64F8335D957792A7E8`:
```shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address 8F89E566BFB2F68DE0DB8E64F8335D957792A7E8

```

Here is an example of splitting coins, we are splitting out three new coins from the original coin (first one on the list above),
with values of 1000, 5000 and 3000 respectively; note that the `--amounts` argument accepts list of values.

```
From the result we can see three new coins were created in the transaction.

## Calling Move code

The genesis state of the Sui platform includes Move code that is
immediately ready to be called from Wallet CLI. Please see our
[Move developer documentation](move.md#first-look-at-move-source-code)
for the first look at Move source code and a description of the
following function we will be calling in this tutorial:

```rust
public fun transfer(c: Coin::Coin<GAS>, recipient: address, _ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    Coin::transfer(c, Address::new(recipient))
}
```

Please note that there is no real need to use a Move call to transfer
objects as this can be accomplish with a built-in wallet
[command](#transferring-objects) - we chose this example due to its
simplicity.


Let us examine objects owned by address `E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317`:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317
Showing 5 results.
(591BADC8D906BAE7FEE95D6B6464A474CCC67ACF, SequenceNumber(0), o#379b792beca0da7b5fb9125171f1ad4b92df10e62e0a00f5de167ac84804c268)

(8E2BA960A97B583B58A0B0C2F0B84366A1A9A1B0, SequenceNumber(0), o#e27579a295e8cda8126731a89f31d506493fe4851e71fdf5b59c62013bb88319)
(A43EE4A5F342807AA3E8B8C795F9175117AF77EB, SequenceNumber(0), o#961474b684418520069ee206be8488765c00a03e938ee484902363aee32d6ed9)
(AF1CF17AA1231461BC274DB0CDDCC49E38687667, SequenceNumber(0), o#35916e592f585d9336d4b808afaa89491ca850d11da4270491ea3d949b9040f9)
```

Now that we know which objects are owned by the address starting with,
we can transfer one of them to another address, say one the fresh one
we created in the [Generating a new account](#generating-a-new-account) section
(`F456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD`). We can try any object,
but for the sake of this exercise, let's choose the last one on the
list.

We will perform the transfer by calling the `transfer` function from
the GAS module using the following Sui Wallet command:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell call --function transfer --module GAS --package 0x2 --args \"0x591BADC8D906BAE7FEE95D6B6464A474CCC67ACF\" \"0xF456EBEF195E4A231488DF56B762AC90695BE2DD\" --gas AF1CF17AA1231461BC274DB0CDDCC49E38687667 --gas-budget 1000
```

This is a pretty complicated command so let's explain all of its
parameters one-by-one:

- `--function` - name of the function to be called
- `--module` - name of the module containing the function
- `--package` - ID of the package object where the module containing
  the function is located. (Remember
  that the ID of the genesis Sui package containing the GAS module is
  defined in its manifest file, and is equal to `0x2`.)
- `args` - a list of function arguments:
  - ID of the gas object representing the `c` parameter of the `transfer`
    function
  - address of the new gas object owner
- `--gas` - an object containing gas used to pay for this
  function call
- `--gas-budget` - a decimal value expressing how much gas we are
  willing to pay for the `transfer` call to be completed to avoid
  accidental drain of all gas in the gas pay)

Note the third argument to the `transfer` function representing
`TxContext` does not have to be specified explicitly - it
is a required argument for all functions callable from Sui and is
auto-injected by the platform at the point of a function call.

The output of the call command is a bit verbose, but the important
information that should be printed at the end indicates objects
changes as a result of the function call:

``` shell

```

This output indicates the gas object whose ID starts with `AF1C`
was updated to collect gas payment for the function call, and the
object whose ID starts with `591B` was updated as its owner had been
modified. We can confirm the latter (and thus a successful execution
of the `transfer` function) by querying objects that are now owned by
the sender:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317
Showing 4 results.
(7154ECD49047FC4554D38C41C92DF91736D5A906, SequenceNumber(0), o#66a13b3428ce27490f5480b1f30c189f0b6372ebc4bae10a9323216d941af22e)

```

We can now see this address no longer owns the object whose ID starts
with `591B`. And if we inspect this object, we can see it has the new
owner, different from the original one
`E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317`:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell object --id 591BADC8D906BAE7FEE95D6B6464A474CCC67ACF

```

## Publish packages

In order for user-written code to be available in Sui, it must be
_published_ to Sui's [distributed ledger](../learn/how-sui-works.md#architecture).
Please see the [Move developer documentation](move.md) for a
description on how to [write a simple Move code package](move.md#writing-a-package),
which we can publish using Sui wallet's `publish` command.

The publish command
requires us to specify a directory where the user-defined package lives.
It's the path to the `my_move_package` as per the
[package creation description](move.md#writing-a-package)), a gas
object that will be used to pay for publishing the package (we use the
same gas object we used to pay for the function call in the
[Calling Move code](#calling-move-code)) section, and gas budget to put
an upper limit (we use 1000 as our gas budget.

Let us use the same address for publishing that we used for calling Move code in the previous [section](#calling-move-code) (`E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317`) which now has 4 objecst left:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell objects --address E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317
Showing 4 results.
(7154ECD49047FC4554D38C41C92DF91736D5A906, SequenceNumber(0), o#66a13b3428ce27490f5480b1f30c189f0b6372ebc4bae10a9323216d941af22e)

(AF1CF17AA1231461BC274DB0CDDCC49E38687667, SequenceNumber(1), o#25c1377fe903fd90ae37ce36e58a1fd16476bec71888ed35e227d3c9e518d9b8)
```

The whole command to publish a package for address
`E7EFB976F10753666C821400FD9554B766363317` resembles the following (assuming
that the location of the package's sources is in the `PATH_TO_PACKAGE`
environment variable):

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell publish --path $PATH_TO_PACKAGE/my_move_package --gas  7154ECD49047FC4554D38C41C92DF91736D5A906 --gas-budget 30000
```

The result of running this command should look as follows:

``` shell

```

Please note that two objects were created and one object was updated. One of the created objects is an object representing the published package:

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell object --id F01D46F07E740042835AEB522A560AC93B766C19
Owner: SharedImmutable
Version: 1
ID: F01D46F07E740042835AEB522A560AC93B766C19
Readonly: true
Type: Move Package
```
From now on, we can use the package object ID (`F01D46F07E740042835AEB522A560AC93B766C19`) in the Sui wallet's call
command just like we used `0x2` for built-in packages in the
[Calling Move code](#calling-move-code) section.

The updated object is the gas object that was used to pay for
publishing But what is the second create object? The answer to this
question is that the (only) module included in the published package
has an initializer function defined which creates a single
user-defined object (of type `Forge`), as described in the part of
Move developer documentation concerning [module
initializers](move.md#module-initializers).

``` shell
./wallet --no-shell object --id  C9C04F5FE32C9D6609610023BE7F395C18608AD8
Owner: AddressOwner(k#e7efb976f10753666c821400fd9554b766363317)

Readonly: false
Type: 0xf01d46f07e740042835aeb522a560ac93b766c19::M1::Forge
```

## Customize genesis

The genesis process can be customized by providing a genesis configuration
file using the `--config` flag.

```shell
./sui genesis --config <Path to genesis config file>
```
Example `genesis.conf`:
```json
{
  "authorities": [
    {
      "key_pair": "xWhgxF5fagohi2V9jzUToxnhJbTwbtV2qX4dbMGXR7lORTBuDBe+ppFDnnHz8L/BcYHWO76EuQzUYe5pnpLsFQ==",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 10000,
      "db_path": "./authorities_db/4e45306e0c17bea691439e71f3f0bfc17181d63bbe84b90cd461ee699e92ec15",
      "stake": 1
    }
  ],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "address": "bd654f352c895d9ec14c491d3f2b4e1f98fb07323383bebe9f95ab625bff2fa0",
      "gas_objects": [
        {
          "object_id": "5c68ac7ba66ef69fdea0651a21b531a37bf342b7",
          "gas_value": 1000
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "move_packages": ["<Paths to custom move packages>"],
  "sui_framework_lib_path": "<Paths to Sui framework lib>",
  "move_framework_lib_path": "<Paths to move framework lib>"
}
```

All attributes in `genesis.conf` are optional, and default values
will be used if the attributes are not provided.
For example, the
config shown below will create a network of four authorities, and
pre-populate two gas objects for four newly generated accounts:

```json
{
  "authorities": [
    {},{},{},{}
  ],
  "accounts": [
    { "gas_objects":[{},{}] },
    { "gas_objects":[{},{}] },
    { "gas_objects":[{},{}] },
    { "gas_objects":[{},{}] }
  ]
}
```
