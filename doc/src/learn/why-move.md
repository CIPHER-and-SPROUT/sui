title: Why Move?
---

This page compares the Move and Solidity programming languages For a full description of the issues with traditional smart contract languages,
see the [Move Problem Statement](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move/blob/main/docs/problem_statement.md).

As one of the first blockchain languages, Solidity has wide adoption. It’s one of the few L1s that has L2s built upon it.

But Solidity is antiquated, an old programming language. Much like JavaScript, it’s cumbersome yet has legacy functions that are still required.

Here are the major advantages of the Move programming language over Solidity:
* More secure
* Less complex
* Infinitely less error prone

Move is inherently more secure than Solidity. Move stores digital assets securely, acting as a keystore. Move wasn’t developed initially for blockchains
yet has growing adoption.

Solidity is simply harder to use. It requires expertise to develop a smart contract that will still need to be audited thoroughly to ensure proper
function. Solidity is plain buggier.
