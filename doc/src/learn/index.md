*Sui: pronounced "sweet" without the "T" - with Transactions (loads of them), things are SWEET indeed. :-)*

Welcome to the documentation for the Sui platform. Since Sui is built upon the core [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move)
programming language, you should familiarize yourself with it and use this content to apply the differences. For a summary of these differences, see
[Sui compared to other blockchains](../learn/sui-compared.md).

For a deep dive into Sui technology, see the [Sui Smart Contracts Platform](../../../paper/sui.pdf) white paper. Find answers to common questions about our [roadmap](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) and more in our [FAQ](../contribute/faq.md).

## See what's new

Find the latest updates to these contents in this section:

* [rustdoc](../build/install.md#source-code) - Find `rustdoc` output for `sui`, `narwhal` and `mysten-infra` projects at both Install and [Contribute to Sui](../contribute/index.md#download-sui).
* [Sui DevNet](../explore/devnet.md) - Experiment with Sui DevNet: request gas tokens, mint/customize example NFTs, publish a Move module, and make a Move call.
* [JSON-RPC API](../build/json-rpc.md) - Set up your own local Sui RPC Server and use the Sui JSON-RPC API to interact with a local Sui network.
* [Narwhal and Tusk for consensus](../learn/architecture/consensus.md) - Learn about Narwhal and Tusk, Sui's high-throughput mempool and consensus engine.
* [RPC API publishing](../build/json-rpc.md#sui_publish) - Follow instructions for publishing Move modules via the Publish endpoint.

See the Sui `doc/src` [history](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/commits/main/doc/src) for a complete changelog of updates to this site. 

## Kickstart development

### Move quick start
Go to the [Move Quick Start](../build/move.md) for installation, defining custom objects, object operations (create/destroy/update/transfer/freeze), publishing, and invoking your published code.

### Wallet quick start
See the [Wallet Quick Start](../build/wallet.md) for installation, querying the chain, client setup, sending transfer transactions, and viewing the effects.

### End-to-end tutorial
Finish with the [Sui Tutorial](../explore/tutorials.md) for a summary view of setting up your environment, starting a Sui network, gathering accounts and gas, and publishing and playing a game in Sui.

## Navigate this site

Navigate and search this site however you see fit. Here is the order we recommend if you are new to Sui:

1. Learn [about Sui](../learn/about-sui.md), how [Sui differs from Move](../learn/why-move.md), and [how Sui works](../learn/how-sui-works.md) starting in this very section.
1. [Build](../build/index.md) smart contracts, wallets, validators, transactions, and more.
1. [Explore](../explore/index.md) prototypes and examples.
1. [Contribute](../contribute/index.md) to Sui by joining the community, making enhancements, and learning about Mysten Labs.
