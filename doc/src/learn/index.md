title: Sui Developer Guides
---

Welcome to the documentation for the Sui platform. Since Sui is built upon the core [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) programming language,
you should familiarize yourself with it and use this content to apply the differences. For a summary of these differences, see
[Sui compared to other blockchains](sui-move-diffs.md).

For a deep dive into Sui technology, see the [Sui Smart Contracts Platform](../../../paper/sui.pdf) white paper.

## Kickstart development

### Move quick start
See the [Move Quick Start](../build/move.md) for installation, defining custom objects, object operations (create/destroy/update/transfer/freeze), publishing, and invoking your published code.

### Wallet quick start
See the [Wallet Quick Start](../build/wallet.md) for installation, querying the chain, client setup, sending transfer transactions, and viewing the effects.

## Navigate this site

Navigate and search this site however you see fit. Here is the order we recommend if you are new to Sui:

1. Learn about Sui, how it differs from Move, and why you should employ it starting in this very section.
1. [Build](../build/index.md) smart contracts, wallets, authorities, transactions, and more.
1. [Explore](../explore/index.md) NFTs, make transfers, and see the Sui API.
1. [Contribute](../contribute/index.md) to Sui by joining the community, making enhancements, and learning about Mysten Labs.
