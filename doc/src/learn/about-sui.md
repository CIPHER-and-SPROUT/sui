title: About Sui
---

Sui is a high performance, horizontally-scalable blockchain with no theoretical limits utilizing extremely low computation resources per
transaction. It is designed from the ground up to facilitate immediate settlement, delivering the high throughput, low latency, and low cost
needed to power applications for billions of users.
 
With existing platforms, users pay a huge tax as network usage increases due to limited throughput. This results in terrible user experiences:

* Games become more expensive to play or entirely unplayable
* Investors lose funds due to inability to liquidate undercollateralized loans in DeFi
* High NFT minting costs
* Only high-value use cases can be experienced (not coupons and other valuable, mass market consumer use cases)

## Unparalleled scalability, immediate settlement

Sui scales horizontally as the demands of Dapps increase. Validators can add more workers to increase the networking, storage
and compute capacity of the network. We are proud to say that Sui is the first proof of stake, decentralized blockchain that scales
beyond the transaction processing capacities of established rails such as VISA & SWIFT while executing safe, turing complete smart contracts.

For example, a network of validators each running an Apple Macbook Pro worker achieves 30,000 TPS with sub second finality. Suiâ€™s linear
scalability means validators increase network throughput by adding more workers to meet network demands. This results in low gas fees even
during periods of high network traffic because the network is able to increase capacity to meet demand. This type of scalability is in sharp
contrast to how blockchains are typically designed.

Additionally with Sui, you can process in batch at extremely low cost. (e.g. massive airdrop with a single transaction for coupons or other
valuable, mass market consumer use cases).

## A language for developers

Sui smart contracts are written in the Move language. Move is safe and expressive, and its type system and data model naturally support the
parallel agreement/execution strategies that make Sui scalable. 

Move is an open-source programming language for building smart contracts originally developed at Facebook for the Diem blockchain. The language is
platform-agnostic, and in addition to being adopted by Sui, it has been gaining popularity on other platforms (e.g., 0L, StarCoin).

Move is naturally immune from [reentrancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)), a critical flaw that attackers have leveraged to
steal millions from Dapps. For developers transitioning from web2 to web3, Move is a much more natural platform to build on without having to
understand the underlying complexities of infrastructure. 

With these extensive properties and benefits, we are confident that Move will become the native execution environment for smart contracts in web3.

## Ability to define richer on-chain assets

Sui permits storage of large objects on-chain, enabling developers to define more complex assets with richer attributes. Additionally, the low-cost
properties of Sui enable developers to move more of their logic and metadata on-chain, increasing composability and transparency for Dapps.

This enables developers to define richer economies that go beyond scarcity for price discovery. Developers can build evolving and dynamic NFTs to
unlock/upgrade and bundle depending on the game and other conditions, such as achieving badges.

## Better user experience for web3 apps

We want to make Sui the most accessible smart contracts platform, empowering developers to create great user experiences in web3. To usher in the next
billion users, developers will need tools to take advantage of the power of the Sui blockchain. The Sui Development Kit (SDK) will enable developers to
build without boundaries.
