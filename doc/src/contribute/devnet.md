title: Experiment with Sui DevNet
---

Welcome to the beginnings of the Sui DevNet. It exists now to gain operational experience with the Sui software in a public setting. The Sui DevNet currently consists of:

* A four-validator network with all nodes operated by Mysten Labs. Clients send transactions and read requests via this endpoint: http://gateway.devnet.sui.io/
* A public network [Sui Explorer](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/explorer-rest/explorer) for browsing the TestNet transaction history: http://explorer.devnet.sui.io
* A Discord channel **LINK** for requesting test coins that can be used to pay for gas on the test network. These coins have no financial value and will disappear each time we reset the network.

TODO: Create and populate Discord link.

Many improvements to the Sui DevNet are underway, such as the ability to run FullNodes and use a browser-based wallet. See the Sui DevNet blog post announcement for full details on upcoming features.

TODO: Create and link to Medium blog post.

To begin building on the Sui TestNet, follow the instructions within [Building Sui](../build/index.md).
