# Primitive Types

The primitive types are the basic building blocks of the language.

These primitive types can be used on their own or can be used be used to build more complex,
user-defined types, e.g. in a [`struct`](../structs.md).

- [Integers](integers.md)
- [Bool](bool.md)
- [Address](address.md)
- [Vector](vector.md)

These primitive types are used in conjunction with other types

- [Tuples and Unit](tuples.md)
