Sui is a decentralized permisionless smart contracts platform
developed with a goal of efficient management of rich assets. Sui uses
low-latency scalable and reliable broadcast between a set of validators to
ensure the safety of common operations on assets. It relies on full
consensus for governance operations and checkpointing performed off
the critical latency path. It uses the [Move](https://github.com/diem/move)
programming language to define assets as typed objects and operations
on these objects.
