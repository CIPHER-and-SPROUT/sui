This repository is dedicated to sharing material related to the FastPay protocol, developed at Novi Financial (formerly Calibra). Software is provided for research-purpose only and is not meant to be used in production.

## Summary

FastNFT extends FastPay by allowing objects to be transacted.

FastPay allows a set of distributed authorities, some of which are Byzantine, to maintain a high-integrity and availability settlement system for pre-funded payments. It can be used to settle payments in a native unit of value (crypto-currency), or as a financial side-infrastructure to support retail payments in fiat currencies. FastPay is based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of full atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting system has low-latency for both confirmation and payment finality. Remarkably, each authority can be sharded across many machines to allow unbounded horizontal scalability. Our experiments demonstrate intra-continental confirmation latency of less than 100ms, making FastPay applicable to point of sale payments. In laboratory environments, we achieve over 80,000 transactions per second with 20 authorities---surpassing the requirements of current retail card payment networks, while significantly increasing their robustness.

## Quickstart with FastNFT Prototype

```bash
cargo build --release
cd target/release
rm -f *.json *.toml
rm -rf db*
killall server

# Create DB dirs and configuration files for 4 authorities.
# * Private server states are stored in `server*.json`.
# * `committee.json` is the public description of the FastPay committee.
for I in 1 2 3 4
do
    mkdir ./db"$I"
    ./server --server server"$I".json generate --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9"$I"00 --database-path ./db"$I" >> committee.json
done

# Create configuration files for 100 user accounts, with 10 gas objects per account and 2000000 value each.
# * Private account states are stored in one local wallet `accounts.json`.
# * `initial_accounts.toml` is used to mint the corresponding initially randomly generated (for now) objects at startup on the server side.
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json create-accounts --num 100 \
--gas-objs-per-account 10 --value-per-obj 2000000 initial_accounts.toml
# Start servers
for I in 1 2 3 4
do
    ./server --server server"$I".json run --initial-accounts initial_accounts.toml --committee committee.json &
done
 
# Query account addresses
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-accounts-addrs

# Query (locally cached) object info for first and last user account
ACCOUNT1=`./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-accounts-addrs | head -n 1`
ACCOUNT2=`./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-accounts-addrs | tail -n -1`
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-objects --address "$ACCOUNT1"
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-objects --address "$ACCOUNT2"

# Get the first ObjectId for Account1
ACCOUNT1_OBJECT1=`./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-objects --address "$ACCOUNT1" | head -n 1 |  awk -F: '{ print $1 }'`
# Pick the last item as gas object for Account1
ACCOUNT1_GAS_OBJECT=`./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-objects --address "$ACCOUNT1" | tail -n -1 |  awk -F: '{ print $1 }'`
# Transfer object by ObjectID
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json transfer "$ACCOUNT1_OBJECT1" "$ACCOUNT1_GAS_OBJECT" --to "$ACCOUNT2"
# Query objects again
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-objects --address "$ACCOUNT1"
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json query-objects --address "$ACCOUNT2"

# Launch local benchmark using all user accounts
./client --committee committee.json --accounts accounts.json benchmark

# Inspect state of first account
grep "$ACCOUNT1" accounts.json

# Kill servers
kill %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 %10 %11 %12 %13 %14 %15 %16

# Additional local benchmark
./bench

cd ../..
```
