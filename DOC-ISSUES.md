# Template for Reporting Documentation Issues

Use the following template to report issues in the Sui GitHub documentation or contents on https://docs.sui.io. For issues with the code, use the ISSUES.md instead.

Copy the contents out of the relevant template and create an issue with them at:
https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new

```
What are the existing URLs containing the issue, if any?

How would you describe the issue? (What needs changing?)

Where should this information land if new? (Learn, Build, Explore, Contribute.)

What changes are needed to support this new feature or product? (A simple overview, detailed procedures?)

Who is the audience for that information? (App developers, investors, creators, validators, someone else?)

What precisely must they do with it? (Configure a new service? Process some output?)

```
