  "description": "You have options when needing to access network-based time for your transactions. If you need a near real-time measurement (within a few seconds), use the immutable reference of time provided by the Clock module in Move. The reference value from this module updates with every network checkpoint. If you don't need as current a time slice, use the epochtimestampms function to capture the precise moment the current epoch started.",
