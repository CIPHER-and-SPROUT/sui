  "description": "Sui supports multi-signature (multisig) transactions, which require multiple keys for authorization rather than a single, one-key signature. In technical terms, Sui supports k out of n multisig transactions, where k is the threshold and n is the total weights of all participating parties. The maximum number of parties is 10. To learn more about the single key signatures that Sui supports, see Signatures.",
