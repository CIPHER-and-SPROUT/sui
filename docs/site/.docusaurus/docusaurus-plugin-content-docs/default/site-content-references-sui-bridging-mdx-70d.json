  "description": "Bridging is the process of moving tokens from one blockchain to another. When you use a bridge to move tokens between blockchains that are incompatible, the tokens are \"wrapped\" by the bridge, which means that they get converted to a derivative token for the target blockchain. You can transfer tokens in from other blockchains to SUI, or transfer SUI tokens out to other blockchains.",
