  "description": "The transferrable witness pattern is based on a combination of capability and witness patterns. Because you should be careful with the witness pattern, you should allow only authorized users to spawn it (ideally only once). Some scenarios, however, require type authorization by module X to be used in another module Y. Or, possibly, there's a case where authorization should be performed after some time.",
