  "description": "The collective ideation that the term tokenomics encompasses includes a wide range of concepts that define the science and behavior of blockchain economies. In basic terms, tokenomics are the financial foundation of blockchains. Much the same way a building with a poor foundation is doomed to fail, a blockchain without a well-researched, extensively planned, and painstakingly implemented token economy eventually crumbles.",
