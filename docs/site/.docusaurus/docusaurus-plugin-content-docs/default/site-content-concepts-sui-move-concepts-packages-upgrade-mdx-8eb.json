  "description": "Sui smart contracts are represented by immutable package objects consisting of a collection of Move modules. Because the packages are immutable, transactions can safely access smart contracts without full consensus (fast-path transactions). If someone could change these packages, they would become shared objects, which would require full consensus before completing a transaction.",
