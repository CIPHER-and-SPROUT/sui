The crate documentation in this section comes from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The content is built from the comments contained in the source code. 

## Source code

You can find the source code in the [crates/sui-framework/packages](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/packages) directory in the `sui` repository on GitHub.

## Crate documentation

The documentation in this section comes from the `crates/sui-framework/docs` directory of the `sui` repository.

## Build documentation

The most recent documentation is available in the `main` branch of the `sui` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:

1. Open a terminal or console to the `sui/crates/sui-framework` directory.
1. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "sui-benchmark" --no-deps`.
1. The docs are built to `crates/sui-framework/docs`.

:::info

If the `cargo doc` does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.
