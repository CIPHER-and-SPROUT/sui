title: Sui Framework
---

The documentation in this section is created from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The process builds the content from comments in the source code.   

## Framework documentation

The child pages to this topic describe the module members for the following libraries:

**<a href="./framework/move-stdlib" data-noBrokenLinkCheck='true'>Move Stdlib</a>:** Modules central to the Move language.

**<a href="./framework/sui-framework" data-noBrokenLinkCheck='true'>Sui Framework</a>:** Modules that create the logic for Sui.

## Source code

You can find the source code for these Move modules in the [crates/sui-framework/packages](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/packages) directory in the `sui` repository on GitHub. As previously mentioned, the comments included in the code provide context for the logic defined.

## Crate documentation

You can review the raw `cargo doc` output of the following documentation in the `sui` repository. The .md files are located in the `crates/sui-framework/docs` directory. Online, they are located at https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/docs.

## Build documentation locally

The most recent documentation is always available in the `main` branch of the `sui` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:

1. Open a terminal or console to the `sui/crates/sui-framework` directory.
1. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "sui-benchmark" --no-deps`.
1. The docs are built to `crates/sui-framework/docs` into their respective subdirectories.

:::info

If the `cargo doc` process does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.
