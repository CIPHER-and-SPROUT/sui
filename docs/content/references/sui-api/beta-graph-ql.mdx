title: GraphQL RPC 
description: The Sui API is migrating from JSON RPC to a GraphQL RPC soon. A beta version is available to you for testing.
---

:::info

This is a beta version providing a READ ONLY snapshot of the Sui Mainnet and Testnet networks. That is, these snapshots provide data up to a fixed checkpoint and are frozen. The beta version is made available for you to get familiar with the upcoming RPC 2.0 in an interactive manner.

:::

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language designed to facilitate building expressive APIs and services that require complex data querying. 

We are providing an early beta version (feature development continues) of the envisioned RPC 2.0, for `mainnet` and `testnet`, where users have access to a READ-ONLY snapshot of the two networks. This is not intended for production-ready applications, but more as a playground to get familiar with the upcoming GraphQL RPC. The [Appendix](#appendix) provides a description on the GraphQL schema. For examples, see the [Query Examples](#query-examples) section.

## Using Sui GraphQL RPC

There are currently two available playgrounds for Sui GraphQL Service:
- `mainnet`: https://graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io/
- `testnet`: https://graphql-beta.testnet.sui.io/

Both instances run the GraphQL IDE, an interactive IDE with autocomplete support and in-built documentation.

## Query examples

An extensive list of query examples is available in the Sui repository: https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples.

Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to data served by the `graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io` service only.

## Limitations and unsupported features

Due to the query richness and highly flexible nature of writing queries, there are limits on the maximum depth and number of nodes in a query. Use the `serviceConfig` field to get the exact values. 

```graphql
{
    serviceConfig 
    {
        maxQueryDepth
        maxQueryNodes
  }
}
```

By default, there is a query timeout of 20s. If the time limit is exceeded, the query is stopped and an error is returned.

As this is only a beta version, there are a few unsupported features and/or limitations:
- There are no performance optimizations, thus some queries may be slower than expected
- Subscriptions are not supported
- Executing transactions and other information on-chain is not possible - the beta release is a READ-ONLY service
- Queries requesting stake related information might be a bit slower or fail the first time, depending on an internal cache. If it fails, try again after a couple of minutes.

# Feedback

We are happy to hear your feedback. Please reply in this thread (link to forums.sui.io post) or in this GitHub issue (link to GitHub RPC issue feedback).
