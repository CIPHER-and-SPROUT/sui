You can pass literal addresses and objects IDs by prefixing them with '@'. This is needed to distinguish a hexadecimal value from an address in some situations. 

For addresses that are in your local wallet, you can use their alias instead (passing them without '@', e.g., --transfer-objects my_alias).
