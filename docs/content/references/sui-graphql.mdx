Sui GraphQL is a public service that enables interacting with the Sui [network](https://sui.io/networkinfo).

To get started with Sui GraphQL, check out the [Getting Started](/guides/developer/getting-started/graphql-rpc.mdx) guide. If you'd like to learn more about the concepts used in the GraphQL service, check out the [GraphQL RPC](/concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx) concepts page.

Check out the `Queries` reference page on the left sidebar for the root types related to querying the service (e.g., doing a `dryRun`). If you'd like to execute a transaction on the network, check out the `Mutations` page in the left sidebar.

As Sui uses an object-centric model, it might be of interest to explore the [Object](/references/sui-graphql/reference/objects/object.mdx) and [Address](/references/sui-graphql/reference/objects/address.mdx) types too. For other types and reference API, consult the pages under GraphQL RPC API shown in the left sidebar.
