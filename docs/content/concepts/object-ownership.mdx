---

Every object has an owner field that dictates how you can use it in transactions. Objects can have the following types of ownership:

- [Owned by an address](./object-ownership/address-owned.mdx) 
- [Dynamic Object Fields](./dynamic-fields/dynamic-object-fields.mdx)
- [Immutable](./object-ownership/immutable.mdx) 
- [Shared](./object-ownership/shared.mdx)
- [Wrapped](./object-ownership/wrapped.mdx)
