Everything on Sui is an object and your smart contracts are inevitably going to need to move those objects around the network, transferring them from one owner to another. The topics in this section explore the options you have on Sui around transferring objects on the network.

## Custom Transfer Rules

On Sui, you can create custom transfer rules for objects that define the transfer conditions that must be met for a valid transfer operation. The object you want to create custom transfer rules for cannot have the `store` ability, as that ability provides unrestricted access to that object without having to go through the module that defines it. 

Go to [Custom Transfer Rules](./transfers/custom-rules.mdx).

## Transfer to Object

On Sui, you are not limited to only transferring objects to an address. You can transfer an object to another object, where the receiving object provides access control to the received object. 

Go to [Transfer to Object](./transfers/transfer-to-object.mdx).
