## Overview

The basic purpose of consensus in blockchains is to agree on the order and ensure the availability of transactions.
Validator operators and users can think of Sui consensus as a black box: validators submit different user transactions to consensus concurrently, and the consensus outputs a consistent stream of transactions across all well-behaving validators.

Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols are a fascinating area of research. If you want a deeper understanding of the consensus black box, the next-generation consensus engine set to roll out in Sui is based on the **Mysticeti** protocol. It represents the cutting edge of research, achieving the optimal frontier of low latency and high throughput by:
- Weaving blocks into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), utilizing the full bandwidth of the network and providing censorship resistance.
- Mysticeti DAGs in particular are uncertified, where it takes only three rounds of messages to commit blocks from the DAGs.

For more details including correctness proofs, the [Mysticeti paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821) is the best source.
