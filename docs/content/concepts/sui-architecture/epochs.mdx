## Epoch
An epoch is a duration of time where the Sui validator set and their stakes remain unchanged. On both mainnet and
testnet an epoch is 24 hours. This allows validator to process transactions efficiently without worrying about
adhoc validator changes during the middle of an epoch.
You can find out the current epoch number on the [[https://suiexplorer.com/ | Sui Explorer]] website.

## Reconfiguration
Reconfiguration is a critical process occurring at the end of each epoch.
It involves several key steps to adjust the network for the upcoming epoch:
1. **Finalizing Transactions and Checkpoints**
    - The network reaches consensus on the final set of transactions and checkpoints for the current epoch. This ensures all validators have an identical state at the epoch's conclusion.
    - **Synchronous Moment**: This is the only fully synchronous event in the network, crucial for maintaining consistency.
2. **Distribution of Gas Rewards**
    - Computation gas fees are distributed to the validator staking reward pool, from which stakers can withdraw.
    - Storage fees are allocated to a storage fund, playing a vital role in the Sui tokenomics, as explaiend in the [[../tokenomics.mdx | Tokenomics]] page.
3. **Validator Set Change**
    - Any pending staking and unstaking requests during the epoch will be finalized and reflected in validators stake distribution.
    - Any pending validator change requests are also processed, including adding new validators and removing exixting validators. This is the sole opportunity for altering the validator set and stake distribution.
4. **Protocol Upgrade**
    - If agreed upon by 2f+1 validators, the network may upgrade to a new protocol version, encompassing new features, bug fixes, and updates to Move framework libraries.
