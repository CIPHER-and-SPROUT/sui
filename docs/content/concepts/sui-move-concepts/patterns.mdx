title: Patterns
description: Move coding patterns, or techniques, solve logic problems you encounter when developing Move packages for the Sui blockchain. These include capabilities, witness and transferrable witness, hot potato, and ID pointer.

Topics in this section introduce Move coding patterns that solve various logic needs in your package development. 

## Capabilities

A capability is a pattern that allows authorizing actions with an object. See [Capabilities](./patterns/capabilities.mdx) for an example of this pattern.

## Witness and transferrable witness

A witness is a type with `drop` that proves that its owner was present at the time of some privileged operation, for example having access to the one-time witness (OTW) for a module proves that the code is being run at the time the module was first published. See the following topics for details.

- [Witness](./patterns/witness)
- [Transferrable Witness](./patterns/transferrable-witness)

## Hot potato

A hot potato is a struct that has no capabilities, therefore you can only pack and unpack it in its module.

- [Hot Potato](./patterns/hot-potato)

## ID pointer

ID pointer is a technique that separates the main data (an object) and its accessors/capabilities by linking the latter to the original.

- [ID Pointer](./patterns/id-pointer)
