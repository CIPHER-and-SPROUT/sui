title: Sui GraphQL RPC
---

This section explains some of the common concepts when working with GraphQL, such as altering behavior using [HTTP headers](./graphql-rpc/headers), re-using query snippets with [variables](./graphql-rpc/variables) and [fragments](./graphql-rpc/fragments), consuming [paginated queries](./graphql-rpc/pagination), and understanding and working within the [limits](./graphql-rpc/limits) enforced by the service.

For more details on GraphQL fundamentals, see the introductory documentation from [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql).
