In order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of each step involved in Sui zkLogin for developers, we provide a zkLogin Example crafted by community member.

![ZKLogin Overview](./images/overview.png "ZKLogin Overview")
This example breaks down the complete process of Sui zkLogin into 7 steps, as follows:

**1. Generate Ephemeral Key Pair**

**2. Fetch JWT**

**3. Decode JWT**

**4. Generate Salt**

**5. Generate User Sui Address**

**6. Fetch ZK Proof**

**7. Assemble zkLogin Signature**

Each step includes corresponding code snippets, providing clear instructions on how to obtain the required data for each step.

## Operating Environment

The example runs in the `Sui devnet`. 

In this example, all data generated by the user is stored locally on the client-side (browser). 

The acquisition of the `Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK Proof)` is done through a call to the [Mysten Labs-maintained proving service](../zklogin.mdx#call-the-mysten-labs-maintained-proving-service).

Therefore, the example runs without the need for an additional deployed backend server(or Docker).

## Storage Locations for Key Data

* **Ephemeral Key Pair**: Stored in ` window.sessionStorage `
* **Randomness**: Stored in ` window.sessionStorage `
* **User Salt**: Stored in ` window.localStorage `
* **Max Epoch**: Stored in ` window.localStorage `

Since the `User Salt` is stored long-term in the browser's `localStorage`, as long as the localStorage (User Salt) is not cleared manually, you can use the same JWT (in this example, logging in with the same Google account) to access the corresponding zkLogin address generated from the current Salt value at any time.

**Note that changing browsers or devices will result in the inability to access previously generated Sui zkLogin addresses, even when using the same JWT.**

## Troubleshooting

- **ZK Proof request failure:**
  - This may occur due to inconsistencies in the creation of multiple randomness or user salts, causing request failures. Click the **Reset Button** in the top right corner to restart the entire process.

- **Request test tokens failure:**
  - This is because the faucet server has request frequency limitations.
