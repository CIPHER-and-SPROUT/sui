title: DenyList
---

The Sui framework provides a `DenyList` singleton, shared object that the bearer of a `DenyCap` can use to specify a list of addresses that are unable to use the specified object. This is useful, for example, when [creating a coin on Sui](../sui-101/create-coin.mdx) that might require the ability to block certain addresses from accessing it. Such is the case for certain stable coins, where regulations require the ability to prevent known bad actors from having access to those coins. See [Create a Coin](../sui-101/create-coin.mdx) for more information on creating coin objects on Sui.

:::info

The `DenyList` object is a system object. You cannot create it yourself.

### DenyCap

When you create certain objects, like a coin using `create_currency_with_deny_list`, you receive a `DenyCap` that gives the ability for the bearer to manipulate the objects in the associated `DenyList`. 

## Manipulating the DenyList



```rust
module examples::mycoin {
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    /// The type identifier of coin. The coin will have a type
    /// tag of kind: `Coin<package_object::mycoin::MYCOIN>`
    /// Make sure that the name of the type matches the module's name.
    struct MYCOIN has drop {}

    /// Module initializer is called once on module publish. A treasury
    /// cap is sent to the publisher, who then controls minting and burning
    fun init(witness: MYCOIN, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 6, b"MYCOIN", b"coin_name", b"description", option::none(), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }
}
```

## Add address to DenyList

```rust
module examples::
use sui::deny_list

fun add_deny_address()
```

## Remove address from DenyList

## 

. You can update the list of addresses, as needed. The network updates the list of denied addresses quickly, without having to form a consensus. 
Defines the `Freezer` type. The `Freezer` shared object is used to restrict access to instances
/// of certain core types from being used as inputs by specified "frozen" addresses.
