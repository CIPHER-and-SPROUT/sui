title: Create Coins and Tokens
---

Coins and tokens on Sui are similar. In practice, the terms are used interchangeably, but there are some differences in their implementation. You can learn about these differences in the respective standard documentation, [Closed-Loop Token](../../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) and [Coin](../../../standards/coin.mdx).

Publishing a coin on Sui is nearly as straightforward as publishing a new type. The main difference is the requirement of a [one-time witness](/concepts/sui-move-concepts/one-time-witness.mdx) when creating a coin.

```move
module examples::mycoin {
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin, TreasuryCap};
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    /// The type identifier of coin. The coin will have a type
    /// tag of kind: `Coin<package_object::mycoin::MYCOIN>`
    /// Make sure that the name of the type matches the module's name.
    struct MYCOIN has drop {}

    /// Module initializer is called once on module publish. A treasury
    /// cap is sent to the publisher, who then controls minting and burning
    fun init(witness: MYCOIN, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 6, b"MYCOIN", b"", b"", option::none(), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }
}
```

The `Coin<T>` is a generic implementation of a coin on Sui. The owner of the `TreasuryCap` gets control over the minting and burning of coins. Further transactions can be sent directly to the `sui::coin::Coin` with `TreasuryCap` object as authorization.

Extending the example further, add a `mint` function to the module. Use the `mint` function of the `Coin` module to create (mint) a coin and then transfer it to an address. 

```move
public fun mint(
    treasury_cap: &mut TreasuryCap<MYCOIN>, 
    amount: u64, 
    recipient: address, 
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let coin = coin::mint(treasury_cap, amount, ctx);
    transfer::public_transfer(coin, recipient)
}
``` 

### Sui CLI

If you published the previous example to a Sui network, you can use the `sui client call` command to mint coins and deliver them to the address you provide. See [Sui CLI](../../../references/cli.mdx) for more information on the command line interface.

```shell
sui client call --function mint --module mycoin --package <PACKAGE-ID> --args <TREASURY-CAP-ID> <COIN-AMOUNT> <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT>
```

If the call is successful your console displays the result, which includes a **Balance Changes** section with the following information included:

```shell
...

Owner: Account Address ( <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> ) 
CoinType: <PACKAGE-ID>::mycoin::MYCOIN 
Amount: <COIN-AMOUNT>

...
```

## Create tokens

The  reuses the `TreasuryCap` defined in the `sui::coin` module and therefore has the same initialization process. The `coin::create_currency` method guarantees the uniqueness of the `TreasuryCap` and forces the creation of a `CoinMetadata` object.

Coin-like methods perform the minting and burning of tokens. Both require the `TreasuryCap`:

- `token::mint` - mint a token
- `token::burn` - burn a token

See [Closed-Loop Token](../../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) standard for complete details of working with tokens.

## Examples

See the following topics for examples of some common use cases for coin and token creation.

- [Regulated Coin and Deny List](./create-coin/regulated.mdx): Create a regulated coin and add remove names from the deny list.
- [Loyalty Token](./create-coin/loyalty.mdx): Create a token to reward user loyalty.
- [In-Game Token](./create-coin/in-game-token.mdx): Create tokens that can be used only within a mobile game.
