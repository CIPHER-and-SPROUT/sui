### Overview
In Sui, a transaction is more than a basic record of the flow of assets. Transactions in Sui represent calls to specific functionality (e.g., calling a smart contract function) that execute on inputs to define the result of the transaction.
Inputs can either be an object reference (either to an owned object, an immutable object, or a shared object), or an encoded value (for example, a vector of bytes used as an argument to a Move call). 
Once a transaction is constructed, usually through using [Programmable Transaction Blocks](./building-ptb), the user signs the transaction and submits it to be executed on-chain.

### Workflow

The following high-level process describes the overall workflow for constructing and executing a transaction on-chain:
* The user constructs the transaction data by creating a `TransactionBlock` where multiple transactions are chained. This is usually done with [Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB)](./building-ptb).
* The SDK's built-in gas estimation and coin selection picks the gas coin.
* The user signs the transaction to generate a [Signature](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/signatures#user-signature).
* The user submits the `TransactionBlock` to be executed on-chain.

:::info
If the user wants to use a specific gas coin, the user should first find the gas coin object id to be used to pay for gas, and explicitly use that in the PTB. If there is no gas coin object, the user should use the [splitCoin](./building-ptb#available-transactions) transaction to create a gas coin object. The split coin transaction should be the first transaction call in the PTB.

### Examples

Here are a few examples on how to transfer SUI in a transaction in different environments and SDKs.

<Tabs groupId="examples-sending-transaction">

<TabItem value="cli" label="Sui CLI" default>

Get the gas coin object id of the active address. This is the coin from which 1000 MIST is transferred to another address.
```shell
sui client gas
```

Transfer 1000 MIST to another address.

```shell
sui client transfer-sui \
--to <SUI_ADDRESS> \
--sui-coin-object-id <GAS_COIN_ID> \
--gas-budget 50000000 --amount 1000
```
