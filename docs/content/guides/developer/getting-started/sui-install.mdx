The quickest way to install Sui is using the binaries delivered with every release. If you require more control over the install process, you can install from source. To take advantage of containerization, you can utilize the Docker images in the `docker` folder of the sui repository.

## Supported operating systems {#supported-operating-systems}

Sui supports the following operating systems:

- Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver)
- macOS - macOS Monterey
- Microsoft Windows - Windows 10 and 11

## Install using Homebrew {#install-homebrew}

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install Sui with the following commands:

```bash
brew tap mystenlabs/tap
brew install mystenlabs/tap/sui
```

## Install from binaries {#install-binaries}

Each Sui release provides a set of binaries for several operating systems. You can download these binaries from GitHub and use them to install Sui.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
1. Go to https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.
1. In the right pane, find the **Releases** section.

    ![Sui releases in GitHub](./images/releases.png)
1. Click the release tagged **Latest** to open the release's page.
1. In the **Assets** section of the release, select the .tgz compressed file that corresponds to your operating system.
1. Extract all files from the .tgz file into the preferred location on your system. These instructions assume you extract the files into a `sui` folder at the user root of your system for demonstration purposes. Replace references to this location in subsequent steps if you choose a different directory.
1. Navigate to the `target/release` directory of the expanded folder. Rename each file to remove the `-ubuntu-x86_64` suffix from each file name. For example, rename `sui-ubuntu-x86_64` to `sui`. If you don't do this step, you must type `sui-ubuntu-x86_64` to execute commands instead of simply `sui`. When complete, you should have the following files:

    - `sui-data-ingestion`: Capture Full node data for indexer to store in a database.
    - `sui-faucet`: Local faucet to mint coins on local network.
    - `sui-indexer`: An indexer for a local Sui network.
    - `sui`: Main Sui binary.
    - `sui-node`: Run a local node.
    - `sui-test-validator`: A binary that starts a local network, a faucet, and several test validators.
    - `sui-tool`: Provides utilities for Sui.

1. Add both folders containing the extracted files to your `PATH` variable. Update your `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` to include the location of the sui binaries. If using the suggested location, add `export PATH="~/sui/target/release:~/sui/external-crates/move/target/release:$PATH"`.
1. Start a new Terminal session or type `source ~/.profile` (or `.bash_profile`) to load the new `PATH` value.

1. Extract all files from the .tgz file into the preferred location on your system. These instructions assume you extract the files into a `sui` folder at the user root of your system for demonstration purposes. Replace references to this location in subsequent steps if you choose a different directory.
1. Navigate to the `target/release` directory of the expanded folder. Rename each file to remove the `-macos-<ARCHITECTURE>` suffix from each file name. For example, rename `sui-macos-arm64` to `sui`. If you don't do this step, you must type `sui-macos-<ARCHITECTURE>` to execute commands instead of simply `sui`. When complete, you should have the following files:

    - `sui-data-ingestion`: Capture Full node data for indexer to store in a database.
    - `sui-faucet`: Local faucet to mint coins on local network.
    - `sui-indexer`: An indexer for a local Sui network.
    - `sui`: Main Sui binary.
    - `sui-node`: Run a local node.
    - `sui-test-validator`: Run test validators on a local network for development.
    - `sui-tool`: Provides utilities for Sui.

    :::info

    Rename `external-crates/move/target/release/move-analyzer-macos-<ARCHITECTURE>` in the same way.

    :::
1. Add both folders containing the extracted files to your `PATH` variable. Update your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to include the location of the sui binaries. If using the suggested location, add `export PATH="~/sui/target/release:~/sui/external-crates/move/target/release:$PATH"`.
1. Start a new Terminal session or type `source ~/.zshrc` (or `.bashrc`) to load the new `PATH` value.

Replace references to this location in subsequent steps if you choose a different directory.
1. Navigate to the `target\release` directory of the expanded folder. Rename each file to remove the `-windows-x86_64` suffix from each file name. For example, rename `sui-windows-x86_64.exe` to `sui.exe`. If you don't do this step, you must type `sui-windows-x86_64` to execute commands instead of simply `sui`. When complete, you should have the following .exe files:

    - `sui-data-ingestion`: Capture Full node data for indexer to store in a database.
    - `sui-faucet`: Local faucet to mint coins on local network.

    :::info

    Rename the `external-crates\move\target\release\move-analyzer-windows-x86_64.exe` in the same way.

    :::

1. Add the folder containing the extracted files to your `PATH` variable. There are several ways to get to the setting depending on your version of Windows. One way that works on all versions of Windows is to type `sysdm.cpl` in a console to open the System Properties window. Under the **Advanced** tab, click the **Environment Variables...** button.
1. In the Environment Variables window, select the `Path` variable and click the **Edit...** button. 
1. In the Edit environment variable window, click **New** and add the path to your expanded folder. Using the example path, this would be `C:\sui\target\release`.
1. Add an additional path pointing to the Move analyzer, as well: `C:\sui\external-crates\move\target\release`, for example.
1. Click **OK**.

### Confirm the installation {#confirm-the-installation}

To confirm that Sui installed correctly, type `sui` and press Enter. You should see a message about the Sui version installed and help for using Sui commands. If the command is not recognized, make sure you're using a new console or terminal window.

## Install from source

Follow the instructions in this topic to install the Rust crates (packages) required to interact with Sui networks, including the Sui CLI.

To install Sui from source, you first need to install its [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system. After installing the supporting technologies, you can install [Sui binaries from source](#install-sui-binaries-from-source).

You can also download the [source code](./sui-environment) to have local access to files.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install Sui.

### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
rustup update stable
```
