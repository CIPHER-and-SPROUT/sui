{@include: ../../../snippets/info-graphql-release.mdx}

For an introduction to GraphQL, see [GitHub's Introduction to GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql).

## Getting Started

The quickest way to access the Sui GraphQL service is through the online IDE that provides a complete toolbox for fetching data and executing transactions on the network. The online IDE provides 
features such as auto-completion (use Ctrl-Space or just start typing), built-in documentation (click on the top-left icon), multi-tabs, and more. 

The online IDE is available for [mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql). 
Later in this document, you can find query [examples](#examples) that you can use directly in the IDE.

:::info

Both [mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) services are rate-limited to keep network throughput optimized.

:::

For more details about some concepts used in the examples below, please see the [GraphQL concepts](concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx) page.


## Discovering the schema
GraphQL offers an introspection feature that allows you to query for the schema that is loaded by a service instance. The [official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) provides an overview on introspection.

## Examples

Many examples can also be found in the [repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples). For example, in that folder you can find examples on [transaction block effects](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/transaction_block_effects), [protocol configs](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/protocol_configs), [stake connection](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/stake_connection), and more. Each folder contains one or more examples that you can use in your queries.

Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to `mainnet` data only.

### Find the reference gas price for last epoch

```graphql
query {
  epoch {
    referenceGasPrice
  }
}
```

### Find the stake information for epoch 100

Find the total stake rewards, the reference gas price, the number of checkpoints and the total gas fees for epoch 100. Note that in the query, the `id` argument is optional. When no id is provided, it will return the data for the last known epoch.

```graphql
query {
  epoch(id: 100) # note that id is optional, and without it, last epoch is returned
  {
    epochId
    totalStakeRewards
    referenceGasPrice
    totalCheckpoints
    totalGasFees
    totalStakeSubsidies
    storageFund {
      totalObjectStorageRebates
      nonRefundableBalance
    }
  }
}
```

### Find a transaction block by its digest

Get a transaction block object by its digest and show information such as the gas sponsor's address, the gas price, the gas budget, and the effects from executing that transaction block.

```graphql
query {
  transactionBlock(digest: "FdKFgsQ9iRrxW6b1dh9WPGuNuaJWMXHJn1wqBQSqVqK2") {
    gasInput {
      gasSponsor {
        address
      }
      gasPrice
      gasBudget
    }
    effects {
      status
      timestamp
      checkpoint {
        sequenceNumber
      }
      epoch {
        epochId
        referenceGasPrice
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Find the last 10 transactions that are not a system transaction

```graphql
query {
  transactionBlocks(last: 10, filter: {kind: PROGRAMMABLE_TX}) {
    nodes {
      digest
      kind {
        __typename
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Find all transactions that touched a given object

Find all the transactions that touched (modified/transferred/deleted) a given object. This is useful for when we want to trace the flow of a coin/stake/nft, and to trace the upgrade history of a package when the given object is a UpgradeCap.

:::info

Note that this example uses GraphQL [variables](/concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#working-with-variables) and [pagination](/concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#pagination). When using the online IDE, you need to pass the variables
in the bottom window where it's written `Variables`.

:::

```graphql
query ($objectID: SuiAddress!) {
  transactionBlocks(filter: {changedObject: $objectID}) {
    nodes {
      sender {
        address
      }
      digest
      effects {
        objectChanges {
          nodes {
            address
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where the variables are:
```json
{
  "objectID": "0x11c6ae8432156527fc2e12e05ac7db79f2e972510a823a4ef2e670f27ad7b52f"
}
```

### Filter transaction blocks by a function

Find the last transaction blocks that called the `public_transfer` function. 

:::info 

This example makes usage of the filter `last`, which indicates that the user only wants the last 10 transaction blocks known to the service. It also uses cursors, which in this examples are used to aid for future pagination needs.

:::

```graphql
{ # Filtering by function
    transactionBlocks(
        last: 10,
        filter: {
            function: "0x2::transfer::public_transfer"
        }
    ) {
        edges { cursor }
    }
}
```

### Find the balance changes of all the transactions

Find the balance changes of all the transactions where a certain address called certain Move functions. This is useful when someone wants to get their staking and unstaking history, since you stake/unstake by calling specific Move functions.

```graphql
query ($address: SuiAddress!) {
  stakeTxns: transactionBlocks(filter: {
    function: "0x3::sui_system::request_add_stake"
    signAddress: $address
  }) {
    nodes {
      sender {
        address
      }
      digest
      effects {
        balanceChanges {
          nodes {
            owner {
              address
            }
            amount
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  unstakeTxns: transactionBlocks(filter: {
    function: "0x3::sui_system::request_withdraw_stake"
    signAddress: $address
  }) {
    nodes {
      sender {
        address
      }
      digest
      effects {
        balanceChanges {
          nodes {
            owner {
              address
            }
            amount
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where address is 
```json
{
  "address": "0xa9ad44383140a07cc9ea62d185c12c4d9ef9c6a8fd2f47e16316229815862d23"
}
```

### Coins on address and its balances

:::info
This example uses aliases and [fragments](/concepts/graphql-rpc#fragments).
:::

```graphql
fragment C on Coin {
  balance
  asMoveObject {
    contents { type { repr } }
  }
}

{
  suiCoins: coins {
    edges {
      cursor
      node { ...C }
    }
  }

  address(address: "0x576f3566219e81748bb599646a5f4f7317068bbe62b143518427b1977b03256d") {
    coins {
      edges {
        cursor
        node { ...C }
      }
    }

    allBalances: balances {
      edges {
        cursor
        node {
          coinType { repr }
          coinObjectCount
          totalBalance
        }
      }
    }

    firstBalance: balances(first: 1) {
      edges { cursor }
    }

    lastBalance: balances(last: 1) {
      edges { cursor }
    }
  }
}

```

### Find the dynamic fields of an object

```graphql
query DynamicField {
  object(
    address: "0xb57fba584a700a5bcb40991e1b2e6bf68b0f3896d767a0da92e69de73de226ac"
  ) {
    dynamicField(
      name: {
        type: "0x2::kiosk::Listing",
        bcs: "NLArx1UJguOUYmXgNG8Pv8KbKXLjWtCi6i0Yeq1VhfwA",
      }
    ) {
      ...DynamicFieldSelect
    }
  }
}

fragment DynamicFieldSelect on DynamicField {
  name {
    ...DynamicFieldNameSelection
  }
  value {
    ...DynamicFieldValueSelection
  }
}

fragment DynamicFieldNameSelection on MoveValue {
  type {
    repr
  }
  data
  bcs
}

fragment DynamicFieldValueSelection on DynamicFieldValue {
  ... on MoveValue {
    type {
      repr
    }
    data
    __typename
  }
  ... on MoveObject {
    hasPublicTransfer
    contents {
      type {
        repr
      }
      data
    }
    __typename
  }
}
```

## Limits

The Sui GraphQL RPC service is rate-limited on all available instances to keep network throughput optimized and to protect against excessive or abusive calls to the service. 

### Rate limits
Queries are rate-limited at the number of attempts per minute to ensure high availability of the service to all users.

### Query limits

In addition to rate limits, queries are also validated against a number of rules on their complexity, such as the number of nodes, the depth of the query, or their payload size.
These limits can be retrieved by querying the `serviceConfig` field. An example of how to query for some of the available limits (at the time of this writing) follows:

```graphql
{
  serviceConfig {
    maxQueryDepth
    maxQueryNodes
    maxDbQueryCost
    requestTimeoutMs
    maxPageSize
    maxQueryPayloadSize
  }
}
```
