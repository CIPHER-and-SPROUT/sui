title: Escrow
---

This guide demonstrates an atomic swap, which does not require a trusted third party, by utilizing a [shared object](/concepts/object-ownership/shared) as an escrow. Shared objects are a unique concept to Sui. They are able to be modified by any transaction and by any signer, given they meet the requirements set forth by the transaction. For more information on shared objects versus owned objects, see [here](/guides/developer/sui-101/shared-owned).

The guide is split into three parts:

1. [Backend](/guides/developer/app-examples/escrow-backend): The smart contracts that hold the state and perform the swaps.
1. [Indexing and API Service](/guides/developer/app-examples/escrow-indexer-api): A service that indexes chain state in order to discover trades, and an API service to read this data.
1. [Frontend](/guides/developer/app-examples/escrow-frontend): Enables users to list objects for sale and to accept trades.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).
- [Configured a valid network environment](/references/cli/client#set-current-environment), as we will be deploying the module on testnet.
