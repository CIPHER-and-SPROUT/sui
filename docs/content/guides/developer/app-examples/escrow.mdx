title: Escrow
---

This guide demonstrates an atomic swap, which does not require a trusted third party, by utilizing a [shared object](/concepts/object-ownership/shared) as an escrow. Shared objects are a unique concept to Sui. They are able to be modified by any transaction and by any signer, given they meet the requirements set forth by the transaction. For more information on shared objects versus owned objects, see [here](/guides/developer/sui-101/shared-owned).

In addition to the smart contract, this example also includes:

- A frontend for people to list object for sale and to accept trades
- A service that indexes chain state in order to discover trades

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).
- [Configured a valid network environment](/references/cli/client#set-current-environment), as we will be deploying the module on testnet.
